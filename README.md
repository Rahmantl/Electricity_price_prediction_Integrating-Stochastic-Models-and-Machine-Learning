# ‚ö° Electricity Price Forecasting ‚Äì Statistical & Machine Learning Models

This repository contains a comprehensive framework for **electricity spot price forecasting**, combining statistical analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling using machine learning techniques. The dataset is based on multiple price hubs including *Indiana*, *Mid C*, *SP15 EZ Gen DA LMP Peak*, and *Palo Verde Peak*.
